The following guidelines always assume you are in the root directory of the git repository you cloned (one folder above the one this file is in).

Getting started:

0- Requierements:
  * To build the Blackbbery 10 application, you must have the Momentics IDE installed with at least the 10.3.1.995 Blackberry 10 Native SDK installed

1- Compile Blackberry 10 liblinphone SDK:
  * Go into the build directory
  * ./prepare.py [-l] <bb10-arm | bb10-i486>
  * make -C WORK/bb10-arm/cmake

2- Move/Copy the requiered SDK files to the assets folder:
  * <cp -R | mv> build/OUTPUT/liblinphone-bb10-sdk/arm/include LinphoneBB10/assets/liblinphone-bb10-sdk/arm/
  * <cp -R | mv> build/OUTPUT/liblinphone-bb10-sdk/arm/lib LinphoneBB10/assets/liblinphone-bb10-sdk/arm/

3- Import the project in Momentics IDE:
  * File -> Import -> Blackberry -> Existing Code as Blackberry C/C++ Makefile Project
    # Set the code location to the directory this file is in
    # Choose C++ as language
  * Edit the bar-descriptor.xml file (in the Source tab) and remove the following lines:
    <configuration name="Device-Coverage">       <platformArchitecture>armle-v7</platformArchitecture>
</configuration>
    <configuration name="Simulator-Profile">       <platformArchitecture>x86</platformArchitecture>
</configuration>
    <configuration name="Simulator-Coverage">       <platformArchitecture>x86</platformArchitecture>
</configuration>
  * Go to the project properties, C/C++ General category, Paths and Symbols section, Source Location tab:
    # Add a new folder "/LinphoneBB10/src"
    # Delete the previous source folder "/LinphoneBB10"

4- Build the project

** LINPHONE FOR BLACKBERRY 10 **
********************************

BUILD PREREQUISITES
*******************

Linphone for BlackBerry 10 depends on liblinphone SDK for BlackBerry10. To 
build this SDK linphone-cmake-builder is used. It is located in the build 
directory. For more information about it, take a look at the README.bb10 file 
in this directory. However the important things to know are that you need:
 - to use a Linux or Mac OS X platform to build
 - to install CMake 2.8.x
 - to install the BlackBerry10 native SDK (Momentics IDE)

BUILDING THE SDK
****************

Read the README.bb10 file in the build directory to know how to do this.

BUILDING AND RUNNING THE TESTERS
********************************

Programs to perform unit tests of the code blocks used by linphone are 
available in the bellesip-tester, liblinphone-tester and mediastreamer2-tester 
directories. Moreover the mediastream utility is also available in the 
mediastream directory.
To learn how to build and run these programs on your BlackBerry 10 device, read 
the README file of these respective directories.

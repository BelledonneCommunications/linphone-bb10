** LIBLINPHONE-TESTER FOR BLACKBERRY 10 **
******************************************

It is possible to build liblinphone-tester for BlackBerry 10 using two methods:
 - using the Momentics IDE
 - using the command line

BUILDING WITH THE MOMENTICS IDE
*******************************

Here are the steps to follow:
 - Start the momentics IDE
 - In the "File" menu, choose "Import..."
 - Choose "Existing Projects into Workspace" in the "General" folder and click 
"Next >"
 - Click "Browse..." for "Select root directory" and choose the current 
directory (the liblinphone-tester directory)
 - Make sure that "Copy projects into workspace" is unchecked
 - Click "Finish"
 - Use the IDE to build, deploy and debug the project

BUILDING WITH THE COMMAND LINE
******************************
First add the following to your PATH: /home/<username>/bbndk/host_10_3_1_12/linux/x86/usr/bin/

Then build the SDK (see README file in above directory)

Finally, in the current directory (the liblinphone-tester directory), run the following 
command:
    $ make run

For the "make run" step to be succesful you will need to add the following 
lines to your SSH configuration (~/.ssh/config):

Host bb10
    Hostname 169.254.0.1
    User devuser
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.blackberry

Replace the IP address by the IP address of your BlackBerry 10 device and the 
IdentityFile by the one you use to connect to your BlackBerry 10 device via 
SSH.

If your BlackBerry 10 IP address is not 169.254.0.1 you will need to change the 
IP address in your SSH configuration as explained above, but you will also need 
to set DEVICE=<ip_address> when using the "make run" command.
If your BlackBerry 10 password is not 1234 you will need to set 
PASSWORD=<password> when using the "make run" command.
If the debug token you use is not located at ~/.rim/debugtoken1.bar you will 
need to tell where to find it with DEBUG_TOKEN=<path_to_debug_token> with using 
the "make run" command.
For example, to run the program on a BlackBerry 10 device with the IP address 
192.168.0.192 and the 5678 password, use:

    $ DEVICE=192.168.0.192 PASSWORD=5678 make run
